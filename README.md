# zebrafish_bacterial_cluster_dynamics
#Code used to simulate EN cluster dynamics
#This code pertains to the simulation in the submission- 'A planktonic mutant induces disaggregation of a competing bacterial species in the zebrafish gut'
#The main mono-association cluster distribution of the bacterial species EN as well as the AE-MB4 invasion cluster distribution is generated using
#final_simulation_gillespie. The rfunctions_gillespie simply has the various functions for generating rates for different cluster processes as well as
#deterministic growth for individuals and clusters.
